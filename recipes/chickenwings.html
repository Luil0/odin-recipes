            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the chicken wings so that you have both the flats and drums.(The drums I save for myself because they are meaty.)</li>
                <li>Pour some avacado oil on them.</li>
                <li>Next you want to season them with the all purpose seasoning and baking powder. Make sure to get all of the wings by spreading them around.</li>
                <li>put them into the air fryer a bit seperated because they might not cook as fast and press the chicken icon on your air fryer or leave them 30 min at 350 degrees fahrenheit.
                <br>
                Flip them over at around 15 min.</li>
                <li>When they are done add a small amount of the sweet baby rays buffalo sauce and put them back in the air fryer for around 2-3 min. After that you can just add as much buffalo sauce as you wish.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            </div>
